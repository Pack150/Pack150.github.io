[Cub Scouting](https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/) 
is a chance to be a part of something fun!
First graders through fifth graders will all find exciting
challenges appropriate for their age.

Scouts learn by _doing_! Pack 379 holds regular events so
that boys get out and _learn while having fun!_ Of course
we get out and hike, but you can also look forward to camping
in a tent, cooking your own meals on a campfire, building and
racing a Pinewood Derby car and more! All of this is done with
the Pack or your Den, which is a smaller group of around eight
boys or girls, all in the same grade.
