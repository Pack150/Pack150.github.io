Cub Scouting is a chance to be a part of something fun!
Boys and girls from Kindergarten through Fifth grade will
all find exciting challenges appropriate for their age.

Scouts learn by _doing_! Pack 150 holds regular events so
kids get out and _learn while having fun!_ Of course
we get out and hike, but you can also look forward to camping
in a tent, cooking your own meals on a campfire, building and
racing a Pinewood Derby car and more! All of this is done with
the Pack or your Den, which is a smaller group of around eight
scouts, all in the same grade.

Cub Scouts is part of the national Boy Scouts of America program
and there is [lots of information about the program available](https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/).
