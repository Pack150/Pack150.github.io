Adventure camp at Beaumont was full of activities and
__ENTHUSIASM!__  Eight Cub Scouts, six parents, and
the wonderful Beaumont staff spent an action-packed
weekend playing water polo, fishing, building campfires
and tent camping. We tried new skills like archery and
firing BB guns as well a bit of hiking.

Capping off the afternoon, and in celebration of the Olympics,
we had team obstacle course races that challenged our physical
abilities. (I'll let you guess if Team Cub Scouts or Team
Grownups won!) Scouts showed their helpfulness by assisting
each other with tent set up and putting worms on each fishing
hooks! Our Beaumont staff led us in a campfire program that
just kept going because we had so many skits to share!

__H-A-P-P-Yâ€”__ we _loved_ Adventure Camp, and hope to return soon!
