We arrived at Classic Park, ready for a great game and a night
of camping on the outfield. The clouds looked ominous, but as game
time approached, we were all hoping we'd catch a break. The Cub
Scouts paraded around the warning track and then we found our
seats, grabbing some hot dogs along the way.

The game began, as did the rain. That was ok, because the boys
got to race their Pinewood Derby cars! During the fourth inning,
a bolt of lightning shut things down and out came the tarp.
Some people left. Some people stayed. As the rain continued, it looked
unlikely that the game would continue, let alone that we
would get to camp! In the end, the weather relented, the game resumed
and the Lake County Captains beat the Lugnuts!

We brought in our gear and set up our tents. Boys from different packs formed
groups playing football and throwing frisbees. The hour grew late and
at one in the morning, the lights were shut off and we went to bed.

The morning came early, but we were treated to a nice warm breakfast before
we were on our way!

Go Captains!
