Keeping track of all of these Cub Scout is hard, let alone communicating with
parents, keeping a calendar of upcoming events, and tracking all of the
advancement requirements! To help with this, we use [Scoutbook](https://www.scoutbook.com/mobile/?ShowLogin=1)
to help with all of this!

When your child joins, you will be sent an email to join ScoutBook. You will be
able to track their progress as well as RSVP for upcoming events
and receive updates and reminders about all of our activities.
