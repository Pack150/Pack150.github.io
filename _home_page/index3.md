Keeping track of all of these Cub Scout is hard, let alone communicating with
all of the parents and keeping track of all of those fun events! To help with
this, we use [Scoutbook](https://www.scoutbook.com/mobile/?ShowLogin=1) to help
with all of this!

When your boy joins, you will be sent an email to join ScoutBook. You will be
able to track your boy's progress as well as RSVP for upcoming events
and receive updates and reminders about all of our activities.
