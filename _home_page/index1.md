Each year, Cub Scouts earn [required and elective Adventures](https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/what-cub-scouts-earn/cub-scouting-adventures/)
to attain a new rank.

* Lion, Kindergarten
* Tiger, First Grade
* Wolf, Second Grade
* Bear, Third Grade
* Webelos, Fourth Grade
* Arrow of Light, Fifth Grade

Adventures are awarded at our monthly Pack meetings. New ranks are awarded at our end-of-year picnic in June.
