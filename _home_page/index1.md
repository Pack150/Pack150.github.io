Every year, Cub Scouts work towards earning a new rank.

* Lion, Kindergarten
* Tiger, First Grade
* Wolf, Second Grade
* Bear, Third Grade
* Webelos, Fourth Grade
* Arrow of Light, Fifth Grade

Cubs earn their rank by earning Adventures, some required and some elective.
These are awarded at our monthly pack meetings to recognize their hard work.
