title: Build Your Adventure!

Every year, Cub Scouts work towards earning a new rank.

* Tiger, First Grade
* Wolf, Second Grade
* Bear, Third Grade
* Webelos, Fourth Grade
* Arrow of Light, Arrow of Light

Cubs earn their rank by earning seven Adventures, some required and some electives.
These Adventure loops and pins are a great way to help fulfill the aims of
Scoutingâ€”build character, develop citizenship, and encourage mental and physical
fitness.
