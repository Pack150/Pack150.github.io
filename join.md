## Step 1: [Fill Out Application](https://my.scouting.org/VES/OnlineReg/1.0.0/?&tu=UF-MB-440paa0150)
Click on the above link and follow the directions to fill out an application. Since you're new, you'll start by creating a BSA ID for yourself. We recommend using the "Login with Google" or "Login with Apple" options to save yourself the headache of yet another password. Your BSA ID will be used when helping your scout track their progress!

As part of your application, you will pay National and Council fees for the remainder of 2021 (about $67), so have your credit card handy! Once your application is complete, our Pack Leaders will approve your application and your scout will be ready to go!

## Step 2: [Pay Pack Dues](https://pack-150-registration-2021-22.cheddarup.com)
Pack Dues ($160) cover registration fees for 2022, along with covering basic needs of Pack 150. Click on the above link, then add _Cub Scout Registration_ to your cart. Answer the questions, check out, and you're all paid up!

## Step 3: Have fun!
Now you can join in the fun of Cub Scouts!
