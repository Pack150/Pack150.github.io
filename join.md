## Step 1: Meet the Pack!
Please come meet Pack 150 on Wednesday September 13th at the South Russell Park Pavillion, 1000 Bell Road.

## Step 2a: [Fill Out Application](https://my.scouting.org/VES/OnlineReg/1.0.0/?&tu=UF-MB-440paa0150)
Click on the above link and follow the directions to fill out an application. Since you're new, you'll start by creating a BSA ID for yourself. We recommend using the "Login with Google" or "Login with Apple" options to save yourself the headache of yet another password. Your BSA ID will be used when helping your scout track their progress!

As part of your application, you will pay National and Council fees for one year (about $130), so have your credit card handy! Once your application is complete, our Pack Leaders will approve your application and your scout will be ready to go!
