Cub Scout Pack 150 is located in Chagrin Falls and is supported by [The
Federated Church](http://fedchurg.org). A Cub Scout Pack includes boys from
First Grade through Fifth Grade, with each grade being part of a smaller group,
called a Den. Our Pack meets on the first Tuesday of each month to celebrate
the achievements of the boys. Dens meet more often, at the convenience of the
families involved. Every month we hold or attend a fun event for the whole Pack!

Interested in joining? Want more information?
Our [Cubmaster](mailto:cubmaster@pack150.org) would love
to hear from you!
