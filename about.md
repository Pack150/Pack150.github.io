Cub Scout Pack 379 is located in Arlingtom, TX and is supported by 
[Woodland West Church of Christ](http://www.woodlandwest.org).  Our pack 
serves boys and girls entering Kindergarden through 5th Grade.  Each child
also belong to a smaller group called a den.  The den meets a few times a
month at a time and place according to the needs of the families in that den.
All of the dens meet together for a larger pack meeting once a month.
