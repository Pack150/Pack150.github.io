Cub Scout Pack 150 is located in Chagrin Falls and is supported by [The Lake Erie Council](http://lecbsa,org). A Cub Scout Pack includes boys and girls from
Kindergarten through Fifth Grade, with each grade being part of a smaller group,
called a Den. Our Pack meets on the first Tuesday of each month to celebrate
achievements. Dens meet more often, at the convenience of the
families involved. Every month we hold or attend a fun event for the whole Pack!
